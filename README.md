# Conditional GAN (CGAN) on MNIST

![GANs Certificate](assets/gans_certificate.png)

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)** trained on the MNIST dataset. The project was developed as a **practical implementation** for the DeepLearning.AI [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-adversarial-networks-gans/) completed on **Oct 28, 2025**.

With this project, I implemented:

- Digit-specific image generation using CGAN.
- Visualization of **generator** and **discriminator losses** during training.
- Optional latent space interpolation between digits.

This work **reinforces my understanding of GAN architectures**, adversarial training, and generative modeling — skills directly applicable to my upcoming research on **EGEAT (Exact Geometric Ensemble Adversarial Training)** for robust deep learning.
